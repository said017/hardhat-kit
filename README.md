# Sample Hardhat Project Enhanced with Kit

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, enhanced with some Plugin. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy
```
